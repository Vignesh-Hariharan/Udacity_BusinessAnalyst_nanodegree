# Udacity BusinessAnalytics nanodegree

As part of Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree Program, we acquire the fundamental abilities required in any sector. These skills include data collecting, analysis, and presentation. Analyze data, create complex business models, and convey the results utilising tools such as SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 

As part of this curriculum, I gained practical experience through working on the projects listed below.

### 1. Interpret Data Visualization:

The aim of this project is to understand any data visualization and are able to find answers for certain questions by the visual elements of the dashboard well and accurately translate them into insights. It also involves in providing own insights, drawing strong conclusion by means of robust analysis. The data used was **LinkedIn Skills dashboard**.


### 3. NYSE Data Analysis:

This project entailed applying statistics and visualization tools to discover and express insights from data from the New York Stock Exchange. It also entails creating Excel models by transforming, analysing, and visualizing data in order to provide the financial model and income statement to demonstrate potential business outcomes.


### 4. Digital Music Database Query:

This project assesses SQL abilities such as how to ask questions about data from several sources, join one or more data sets explicitly, compute aggregates, and react to inquiries using queries. The Chinook Music database is utilised to better comprehend the media in their store, and their customers, employees, and invoicing information.


### 5. Build Data Dashboards

This project focuses on visual story telling abilities, incorporating the design and visualisation concepts to produce effective Tableau dashboards. The representation must be clear and explain the facts to the readers using the interactive or animated capabilities of the tableau visualisation tool. The dataset used is US Airline Delays, which analyses the on-time performance of significant air carriers operating domestic flights in the United States in 2015. The image provides answers to inquiries such as which states saw frequent cancellations and month-to-month cancellation trends.
